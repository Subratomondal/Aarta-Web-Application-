            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Our Commitment to Quality</h2>
            <p>At Aarta, our mission is to connect you with unique, handcrafted items from talented independent artists across India. Each piece is made with care, and we want you to be delighted with your purchase. This policy outlines the process for returns and refunds in the rare event that your order does not arrive as expected.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">1. Return & Reporting Window</h2>
            <p>Please inspect your order immediately upon receipt. You have <strong>24 hours</strong> from the time your order's tracking status is marked as "Delivered" to report any issues and request a return.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Note on Delivery:</strong> If the outer shipping package arrives visibly crushed, torn, or severely damaged, we strongly advise you to <strong>refuse the delivery</strong> from the courier. Please take a photo of the damaged package and contact our support team at <a href="mailto:subratomondal374@gmail.com" class="text-brown hover:underline">subratomondal374@gmail.com</a> immediately so we can resolve the issue with the artist and courier.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">2. Valid Reasons for a Return</h2>
            <p>We accept returns only under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Item Arrived Damaged:</strong> The product itself (not just the outer packaging) is broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged.</li>
                <li><strong>Incorrect Item Received:</strong> You received a different product, color, or variant than what was listed on your order confirmation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused, in the same condition you received it, and in its original packaging.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">3. Non-Returnable Items</h2>
            <p>To protect the livelihood of our independent artists, we cannot accept returns for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>"Change of Mind."</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Custom-made or personalized orders.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Slight Variations:</strong> As all our products are handcrafted, slight variations in color, texture, or pattern are a natural part of the item's uniqueness and are not considered defects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">4. How to Initiate a Return</h2>
            <p>If your return request meets the criteria above, please follow these steps within the 24-hour window:</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">5. The Refund Process</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Approval:</strong> If your return request is approved, you will receive instructions on how to return the item to the artisan.</li>
                <li><strong>Return Shipping:</strong> For approved returns, the artisan is responsible for arranging and covering the cost of the return shipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspection & Refund:</strong> After the artisan confirms receipt of the returned item, Aarta will process a <strong>full refund</strong> to your original payment method. Please allow 5-7 business days for the refund to appear in your account.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">6. Our Role as Mediator</h2>
