            <p>Welcome to the Aarta community of artists! We are thrilled to have you. Our mission is to provide a platform where your creativity can meet commerce. To ensure a fair, safe, and high-quality experience for everyone, we require all our sellers to adhere to the following guidelines.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">1. Product Listings & Authenticity</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Handmade by You:</strong> All products listed on Aarta must be handmade by you or your small collective. We do not permit the reselling of mass-produced items.</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate Descriptions:</strong> Your product descriptions must be honest and accurate. This includes materials used, dimensions, and any unique characteristics.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Product Dimensions & Weight:</strong> When listing a product, you must provide the accurate weight (in grams) and dimensions (L x W x H in cm) of the <strong>final packed item</strong>. This is crucial for our system to calculate the correct shipping cost.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Quality Photography:</strong> Clear, well-lit photos are essential for sales. You must upload high-resolution images that accurately represent your products. We require a minimum of 3 photos per listing. Do not use photos that you do not have the rights to.</li>
                <li><strong>Prohibited Items:</strong> The sale of illegal items, hateful items, or items that infringe on intellectual property is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate account termination.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">2. Packaging & Pickup</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Quality Craftsmanship:</strong> You are responsible for the quality of your products. Items should be well-made, durable, and free of defects.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Packaging:</strong> It is your responsibility to package your items securely to prevent damage during shipping. We recommend using sturdy boxes, ample padding (like bubble wrap), and waterproof outer layers. Aarta is not responsible for damage caused by inadequate packaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Ready for Pickup:</strong> You must have the order packaged and ready for pickup by our logistics partner within <strong>2 business days</strong> of receiving a notification of sale.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">3. Shipping & Order Fulfillment (Managed by Aarta)</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Aarta Manages Shipping:</strong> To provide a consistent and reliable experience for customers, Aarta will manage the shipping process through our official logistics partner.</li>
                <li><strong>Pickup Coordination:</strong> Once you mark an order as "Ready for Pickup" on your dashboard, our system will automatically schedule a pickup from your registered address.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Our logistics partner will provide a tracking number, which will be automatically updated on the order page and sent to the customer. You do not need to manually enter this.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">4. Our Commission & Payouts</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Commission Structure:</strong> To support our artists, we use a fair commission model. Aarta's commission is <strong>12%</strong> of the pre-tax sale price of the item, or a <strong>minimum of â‚¹30</strong>, whichever is greater. This commission does not apply to the shipping cost paid by the customer.</li>
                <li><strong>Payouts:</strong> Payouts for completed orders will be processed to your registered bank account on a bi-weekly basis. A sale is considered "complete" 7 days after the order is successfully delivered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">5. Adherence to Policies</h2>
            <p>By selling on Aarta, you agree to abide by our <strong>Terms of Service</strong>, <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, and <strong>Return & Refund Policy</strong>. Violations of these policies may result in a warning, temporary suspension, or permanent termination of your seller account.</p>
            <p>We are partners in this journey. Our goal is to help you succeed. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our seller support team.</p>
